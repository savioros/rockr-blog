## Project description
This is a project provided by Coderockr. With the design provided, i built a full responsive blog using modern development tools. The folder architecture was made aiming for the greatest possible scalability.

On the homepage you can see a lot of cool posts and in addition it has Infinite Scroll. Clicking on any post will redirect you to a page with full details.

We also have a contact modal and the best thing is that it actually works by sending emails. To do this I used EmailJS.

Finally, we have a page where the user can create new posts.
